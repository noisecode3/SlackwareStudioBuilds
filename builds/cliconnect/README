CliConnect is a command-line-interface (CLI) based Connection manager.
Its primary focus is to allow users connect items in a visible and
logical way, even when using a terminal.

Usage

CliConnect uses vim like key-bindings to navigate the ports listed in
the bottom half of the screen. The top half of the screen lists
connections.

j        move down
k        move up
h        switch to left port list
l        switch to right port list 
r        rescan port list
space    connect / disconnect
q        quit
