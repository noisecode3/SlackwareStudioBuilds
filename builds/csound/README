Csound is a sound and music computing system that has its roots in the earliest
of computer software, the MUSIC-N series by Max Mathews. Csound was originally
released in 1986 by Barry Vercoe and it has been a part of the computer music
world since. Todayâ€™s Csound works on desktop, mobile, embedded, server, and web
platforms and powers music software and music-making for musicians around the world.

I tried this example:

csound --output=test.wav oblivion.csd

It creates some synth symphony 
A lot of old csound example seem to not work anymore
