Fabla is an open-source LV2 drum sampler plugin instrument. It is
ideal for loading up your favorite sampled sounds and bashing away on
a MIDI controller. Or if it’s crafty beat programming your after
that’s cool too! The ADSR envelope allows the shaping of hi-hats and
kicks while the compressor beefs up the sound for thumping kicks!
