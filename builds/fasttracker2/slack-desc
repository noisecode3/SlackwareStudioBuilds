# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fasttracker2: The FT2 interface is largely inspired by the looks of Amiga's 
fasttracker2: Protracker. The screen consists of a pattern editor in the lower half,
fasttracker2: while the upper half features an instrument selector on the right,
fasttracker2: and the general module settings and some oscilloscopes. The pattern
fasttracker2: editor can be switched to sample/instrument editors.
