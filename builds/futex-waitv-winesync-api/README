This packaged add futex_waitv and winesync userspace API to the
existing kernel-headers package. Without this you will get only
esync from compiling wine-tkg, proton or other wine
with fsync_futex_waitv.patch.

You need to rebuild and reinstall this package if you upgrade
you're Slackware15 linux 5.15 kernel-headers package.
This is safe and only processes that owns the same
userspace memory handled with threads can use it. This wont affect
glibc on Slackware15 and if you updated you're headers
the futex wait API will just be overwritten by kernel-headers
package. winesync.h on the other hand won't be overwritten.

The non patched Linux kernel 5.15 don't know about
__NR_futex_waitv 449 and will ignore it and return an error
resulting in wine defaults back to esync.

So you only need this for compiling wine-tkg. But if you have a kernel with
futex_waitv or winesync, pre-compiled (binary) wine-tkg will still work with fsync
without this.
