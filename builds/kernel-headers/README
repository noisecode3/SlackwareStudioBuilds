This makes a headers package if you really need it

You may only need this for wine or software targeting user space calls.
Drivers targeting a newer headers matching you're kernel

ALL OTHER SOFTWARE EXCEPT WINE "SHOULD" BE BUILD WITH SLACKWARE'S
DEFAULT HEADERS! NOT DOING SO COULD DAMAGE YOU SLACKWARE INSTALLATION!

You should not install this on top of the kernel-headers

upgradepkg --reinstall /tmp/kernel-headers

If the source is /usr/src/linux-6.4.7-zen
You may need to set VERSION to 6.4.7-zen
