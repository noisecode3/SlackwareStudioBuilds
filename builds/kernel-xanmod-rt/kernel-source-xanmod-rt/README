This is kernel-source-xanmod-rt package.
It's a copy of the xanmod-rt source code installed in
/usr/src/ without touching the linux symbolic link.
If you apply patches after you installed this, you
need to copy them into the source directory, the other
package scripts will only read the config file and look
patches there and apply them like a sandwich.

PATCH_DIR=/full/path/to/the/directory/of/patches/of/love
CONFIG=/full/path/to/kernel/config/file

kernel-generic-xanmod-rt
kernel-headers-xanmod-rt
kernel-modules-xanmod-rt

This are the packages will be based on the config and
patches found in /usr/src/linux-5.15.*-rt*-xanmod1
provided by this package. Patches need to be in the format
.patch or .patch.xz

Everything is set to be verbose. Analyse the output
to see how the patching went and from where the config
was copied.
