The kernel-source-xanmod pakage is a copy of the xanmod
source code installed in /usr/src/ without touching the
linux symbolic link in /usr/src. The other package scripts will
read the config file and the source when building the kernel.
This way you can also build the kernel manually and try out changes
and configurations before you save them, keeping manually building
and packaging the kernel separated and simple with all options available.
Point to you config file and patch directory with a leading "/", if you don't
it will be relative to /tmp/SBo/package-kernel-source-xanmod/usr/src/linux../
that is probably not what you want.

PATCH_DIR=/full/path/to/the/directory/patches
CONFIG=/full/path/to/kernel/config/file

This are the packages that will be based on the config and
patches found in /usr/src/linux-5.15*-xanmod1
provided by this package. Patches need to be in the format
.patch or .patch.xz

This pkg is needed for only this kernel pkg
kernel-xanmod that have both kernel and modules

Everything is set to be verbose. Analyse the output
to see how the patching went and from where the config
was copied.

Remove any old xanmod kernel packages before you install
except for futex-waitv-winesync-api is OK
RUNNING THE SCRIPT WILL NEED INTERNET AND GIT
You can set REMOVE_GIT=YES to remove .git directory

If you set VERSION it will switch branch
VERSION=6.0-rt this is experimental stick with default for now

Pleas give feedback, if you see something in kernel config or in the
script that you think could be better. E-mail me or open pull request
on git against this packages. The config-new is experimental... 
Start with the default slackware64-generic
