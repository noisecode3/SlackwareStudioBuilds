Xanmod 5.15 kernel

This kernel unlock some serious performance improvements.
This build was made for Slackware and for better use of wine-tkg.

You might need to set VERSION=5.15.89 to you git kernel version
because it can change when the git kernel-source pkg auto updates
I might change this next time. I want to automate as much as possible
and also make the script and download secure. I think I also might
remove my configs and only use slackware's default generic for the
default. Want you to be involved in configuring you own kernel if not
I don't think I should enforce my own idea of the configuration.

Don't forget to configure you're boot manager.

Path to kernels:

/boot/vmlinuz-generic
/boot/vmlinuz-huge
/boot/vmlinuz-generic-xanmod

Don't forget you're mkinitrd command and update you're boot loader!

Initrd command:
/usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 5.15.*-xanmod1

If you have Intel processor you must load microcode early!
Add -P /boot/intel-ucode.cpio to the generated mkinitrd command!

This kernel will preform better with rtirq
sbopkg will try to compile kernel modules
for this kernel with default option on

This is experimental remove all old kernel-... pkgs before they are conflicting
