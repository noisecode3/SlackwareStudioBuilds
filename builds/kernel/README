Xanmod kernel

This kernel should be used and will preform better with rtirq
RUNNING THE SCRIPT WILL NEED INTERNET AND GIT
If you set VERSION it will switch branch
VERSION=6.6-rt ./kernel.SlackBuild
KERNEL=zen VERSION="6.6/main" ./kernel.SlackBuild

There is a copy of the xanmod source code installed in /usr/src/
without touching the linux symbolic link in /usr/src.
Point to you config file and patch directory with a leading "/", if you don't
it will be relative to /tmp/SSb/package-kernel-xanmod/usr/src/linux../
that is probably not what you want.
This build was made for Slackware and for better use of wine-tkg.

I want to automate as much as possible and also make the script
and download secure. Spend some time to configure you kernel.

Don't forget to configure you're boot manager also :)

Path to kernels:

/boot/vmlinuz-generic
/boot/vmlinuz-huge
/boot/vmlinuz-xanmod

Don't forget you're mkinitrd command and update you're boot loader!

Initrd command:
/usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k version-xanmod1

If you have Intel processor you must load microcode early!
Add -P /boot/intel-ucode.cpio to the generated mkinitrd command!

PATCH_DIR=/full/path/to/the/directory/patches
CONFIG=/full/path/to/kernel/config/file

Patches need to be in the format .patch or .patch.xz

Everything is set to be verbose. Analyse the output
to see how the patching went and from where the config
was copied.

You can set REMOVE_GIT=YES to remove .git directory

Pleas give feedback, if you see something in kernel config or in the
script that you think could be better. E-mail me or open pull request
on git against this packages. The config is the default slackware64-generic
