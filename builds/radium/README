The development of Radium started in 1999 based on ideas developed
1997-1999 while extending the Octamed tracker on the Amiga. The first
public version of Radium was released in 2000. Since then, Radium has
been ported to Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Today, Radium is probably
the worlds largest and most advanced tracker-like music editor.

This build is dirty and experimental, not finnished.
