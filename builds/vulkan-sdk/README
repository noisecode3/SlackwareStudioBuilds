This is a modified vulkan-sdk from slackware.com because there was some
problems with fetch-sorces.sh there. I took out the git part so its not
needed for getting the code. It builds Vulkan 1.3.224.1. You can make
changes in config-versions but run update-tags.sh after.

You might need "pip3 install jsonschema" and multilib
also compile 32bit version in a virtualbox or if you install
32bit slackware on a second drive.
