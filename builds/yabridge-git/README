Yet Another way to use Windows VST plugins on Linux. Yabridge seamlessly
supports using both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2 and VST3 plugins in a
64-bit Linux VST host as if they were native VST2 and VST3 plugins, with
optional support for plugin groups to enable inter-plugin communication
for VST2 plugins and quick startup times. Its modern concurrent
architecture and focus on transparency allows yabridge to be both fast
and highly compatible, while also staying easy to debug and maintain.

This script will build yabridge-git both 64bit and 32bit plugin hosts
on Slackware64 and only 32bit plugin host on Slackware with yabridgectl
helper tool. This script depends on any wine64/32 version for
Slackware64 and any wine32 version for Slackware. No ARM support yet.

Make sure you have configured you're system with real-time priority.
Don't forget WINEESYNC=1 or WINEFSYNC=1 environment variables.

IMPORTANT to understand is that you need an internet connection
for these meson wrap subprojects:

Asio
bitsery
function2
ghc::filesystem
tomlplusplus
VST3 SDK
clap

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES NOT NEEDED FOR COMPILING

winetricks: For correct fonts displayed by plugins
rtirq: For better latency of audio peripherals
